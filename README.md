Perdicting_Bioconectration_factor
	The development of QSAR models useful for the prediction of fish bioconcentration factor (BCF) for a wide range of different chemical classes is crucial for the assessment and prioritisation of potentially persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances.
 In this study we present QSAR models for BCF developed on a wide range of chemical structural classes of environmental and toxicological interest (such as dyes and various chlorinated and brominated compounds). The aim is to provide valid QSAR models, statistically validated for predictivity, for the prediction of BCF in general, but also for problematical chemical classes such as highly hydrophobic chemicals.
